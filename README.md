Major Tom and his team are running out of oxygen and need your help to find the fastest way to 2MASS J23062928-0502285, also known as TRAPPIST-1. You are the head of the ground control centre on Earth and are responsible for handling all the data you receive from the spacecraft. Use this data as best you can to get everyone safely to their destination before they run out of oxygen. Are you ready to lead this life-saving mission?
